	Comments: Frames of doors are padded with a blank slot of width 32 pixels by height 64 pixels. There is padding to the left of 	the 1st door and padding to the right of the last door. Do not use these areas of padding. The doors appear to have a gap at the bottom but this is for the purposes of perspective once they are aligned with walls.
