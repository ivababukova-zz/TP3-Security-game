Bugs: -

1. Password input: - moving cursor back and forth with arrow keys(maybe even mouse click positioning) ~ Antanas
2. Map Collision: - fix collisions(DONE) & sprite behind door(? may be fixable once we have our own character added to the game) ~ Bryan

4. The 'w' bug that Andy introduced/inpute for password note :p ~ Antanas
5. Door animation bug RE overlaps ~ Bryan

Features: -

1. Score System ~ Andy

5. Cancel option for password input ~ Antanas
6. if door already has a password, allow for a reset ~ ?
7. entropy variable to be added to doors ~ ?

Enhancements: -

5. Menu graphics: - Specifications & Design ~ Andy & Bryan
6. Difficulty setting (parameters for game states etc...) ~ ?
7. Policy image colour coding - red, green blue yellow orange (photoshop by Bryan, then object refinement on map for relevant tiles to be replaced) ~ Bryan (DONE)

Ideas: - 

1. RE writing down passwords: - what if the player was able to write their passwords explicitly or some kind of reminder/clue that they could use to help themselves remember? THen we would require an algorithm that was able to check the likeness to the password that the note relates to. For notes that are very similar, a higher penalty can be induced. This gives more purpose to the note writing facility as it would no longer be an automatic punishment for using the tools that we have provided to the user.
